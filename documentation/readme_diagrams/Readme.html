<h1 id="general">General</h1>
<h2 id="record-types">Record Types</h2>
<p>There are three types of records</p>
<h3
id="individual-records-describe-properties-of-one-single-artwork.">Individual
records describe properties of one single artwork.</h3>
<p>They consist of four records joined together with 1:n connections</p>
<ul>
<li>Artwork: the artwork as object, with information on medium, making
processes, whereabouts, and illustrated text</li>
<li>Image: a part of the artwork showing a specific scene, with
information on iconography and image cycles</li>
<li>Copy: only relevant for artworks that exist in multiple copies,
e.g. prints, information on whereabouts of the copy from which the image
is taken</li>
<li>Photo: information on the photograph, also on downloading
options</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-records">‘Group records’</h3>
<p>This group is not yet well developed, it should contain at least two
- rather different - types of records</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Matrix: contains information (making processes, connected
iconographies, connected illustrated texts) relevant for all artworks
that are impressions of the same printing matrix. Only relevant for
printed book illustrations.</p></li>
<li><p>Cycle: holds together a group of Images that were made together
and have a joint iconographic significance (simple example. images of
the Four Evangelists on a pulpit)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>0.0.2 Authority Records They consist of a larger number of records
that can be linked to a greater number of Artwork (or Group) records,
among them are</p>
<ul>
<li>Iconography</li>
<li>Theme of a Cycle</li>
<li>Person</li>
<li>Personification</li>
<li>Animal/Plant</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Organisation (Collection, Monastery, Guild, etc.)</li>
<li>Place</li>
<li>Office</li>
<li>Text</li>
<li>Activity</li>
<li>Element of a coat-of-arms (see below)</li>
<li>General Keyword / Heading</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these records should be self-explanatory - with exception of
the Office record. It is used to group depicted persons together. Each
office record consists of a profession and an organisation or a place
(e.g., King of England, Canon of Augsburg). Indicating an Office and a
time would be a convenient way to locate a historical figure.</p>
<p>Amnongst them, the Place and Text Authority Records normally come in
hierarchically ordered groups, e.g. Region &gt; Town &gt; Building &gt;
Building Part &gt; Multi-part artwork Text &gt; Chapter &gt; Passage
&gt; Quotation</p>
<p>Iconography records can contain variants. In this case, there is one
or more criteria, each with several options that may or may not be
mutually exclusive (e.g. criterion: “with sword”, options “yes”, “no”,
“uncertain”, “to be determined”). The Iconography is hence determined by
the indication of an Iconography record and a list the IDS of all
selected options. It is also possible to have some Criteria that appear
rarely, and that have only one Option with an ID, selected if the
Criterion applies. The records ‘Theme of a Cycle’ are similar to the
Iconography records, but probably do not need variants.</p>
<p>Similar systems of variants would probably used for records
describing elements of coats-of-arms (e.g., for different tinctures or
postures of heraldic lions). Hence, they should be separate from
e.g. the record of the animal ‘lion’ (I thought of having similarly
separate records for attributes and elements of emblems, but this may
not be necessary)</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-records-in-theory">Structure of Records (in
theory)</h2>
<p>Records can have the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attributes (names, dates, comments etc.)</li>
<li>External References</li>
<li>Connections to other records (containing information on the type of
relationship, numbers for displaying the connections in a logical order
and alternative names for previews. Some of this information is relevant
for both directions of the connection, other only for one
direction)</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="structure-of-records-attempt-to-apply-this-structure-to-mongodb">Structure
of Records (attempt to apply this structure to MongoDB)</h2>
<p>In practical terms, most of the records will be saved as ‘Node’
entities, with the connections saved as ‘Edge’ entities so that
connections can be made or broken without having to change the
‘Nodes’.</p>
<p>The ‘records’ are dissoved into a system of ‘Nodes’ and ‘Edges’.</p>
<p>A ‘Node’ contains - Attributes for names, comments, etc.(list of
key-value pairs, the value being a list of strings) - Dates (each
consisting of a date string for display and a start and end date as
tuples for searches) - External references (each consisting of the name
of an external resource such as the GND, the ID of the object in this
resource, and the URI of the record of thisobject in the resource)</p>
<p>An ‘Edge’ contains: - Links to two ‘Nodes’ - Dates (are always
relevant for both directions of the connection)= - Attributes (as above)
relevant for both directions of the connection - Attributes (as above)
relevant for connection to the first ‘Node’ only - Attributes (as above)
relevant for connection to the second ‘Node’ only</p>
<h2 id="material-stored-outside-the-database">Material stored outside
the database:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Image files for display/download, in a format that allows quick
display on the web and zooming in</li>
<li>Image files of printed book illustrations for identifying re-uses of
matrices. They have to follow specific criteria (e.g., probably b/w,
relatively low res). If VISE is used for these comparison (see below)
they have to be indexed in a specific way, and it is probably necessary
to have a main collection and some small temporary collections that are
from time to time ingested in the main collection (necessitating major
reindexing).</li>
<li>Lists of permitted media, connection types etc., stored in a config
file for easy access.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="general-structure">General Structure</h1>
<p>Some functions (largely search and display) can be used by anyone,
others (ingest and edit) only by registered editors. It may be best to
have one interface, with a numer of functions blocked for non-registered
users. Changes by registered editors should be logged (primarily for
training new editors)</p>
<p>The following types of functions are needed:</p>
<p>Ingest Photos</p>
<p>Create records manually</p>
<p>Fill newly created records / Edit records</p>
<p>Search for records</p>
<p>Display records</p>
<p>Export data</p>
<h1 id="ingest-photos">Ingest Photos</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>This is the most common way for creating records - not only artwork
records, but also group and authority records connected to them. In
nearly all cases (perhaps with the exception of <a
href="#ingest-photos-from-a-museum">Ingest from a Museum</a>), newly
ingested Artwork records still lack essential information and need
manual filling. Hence, they should be marked as ‘in progress’ - they
should be suppress in public searches, but editors should be able to
search for these records only (in order to edit and then make them
public). Furthermore, Authority records ingested in this process will
probably need additional information and should likewise only released
once they had been manually edited (probably first thing, before the
individual records). Especially if several editors are working on the
database, it makes sense to establish ingest processes. An editor would
create a new process and ingest a number of images - probably not more
than a few hundred - in this process. The individual records of these
images can then be filled manually and published when ready. Once the
last image (and the last authority record ingested in this process) have
been published, the process can be closed.</p>
<h2 id="ingest-photos-from-local-drive">Ingest Photos from local
drive</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>A number of photographs are uploaded, and Individual records are
created for them.</li>
<li>The user can specify the following information:
<ul>
<li>If the images represent different Artworks, or several Images of one
Artwork, or several Copies of one Image, or several Photos of one
Copy</li>
<li>Whereabouts (Collection of Place)</li>
<li>Medium</li>
<li>Making processes (only possible, once Medium has been specified,
according to medium), each can have a process type, credibility of
attribution, Person, Place, and Date</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If any of the selected Persons, Places, or Collections are already
in the database, Edges between them and the record are created -
otherwise, Authority records for them are being ingested or created, and
Edges are established with them.</li>
<li>In rare cases (e.g., lost artworks that should be recorded because
copies after them are in the database), it would also be possible to
create these records without uploading an actual image. In this case,
there would be no Photo record (and probably also no Copy record).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ingest-photos-from-a-museum">Ingest Photos from a Museum</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>This function has not yet been built in the prototype - it is largely
‘Zukunftsmusik’ since, as of 2025, only very few museum database have
APIs. Since there is currently no standard similar to IIIF, this
function would probably need considerable adjustment for every
museum.</p>
<p>It could work as follows: - A search is executed in the Museum
Database via the API - The results are deduplicated with the contents of
the database (probably via inventory number) - The results are displayed
for manual selection - Full information on the selected results is
downloaded via the API - Individual records are created for every
imported artwork. - The editor goes through the imported artworks one by
one (it must be possible to interrupt and resume this process): - For
each artwork, a search for artists and places is done in the database
and, when it fails, in external resources. The editor can select the
appropriate match or, if necessary, import or create new authority
records. - For each artwork, the iconography records from the museum
database are matched with the records in the database. The editor can
confirm these matches (and supply missing data, e.g. about iconographic
variants), change the iconography, or delete it and add it later.</p>
<h2 id="ingest-photos-from-a-library">Ingest Photos from a Library</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This is the most complex scenario, consisting of two, for printed
images of three steps.</li>
<li>Since the second and third step necessitate going through all images
one by one, they can take considerable time, hence it must be possible
to interrupt and resume these processes.</li>
<li>It may make sense to have a list of all manuscripts and books
currently in this process, indicating what stage theyre in, and allowing
the editors to start or resume work at the appropriate place.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1-downloading-information-on-the-book-or-manuscript">Step
1: Downloading information on the Book or Manuscript</h3>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Editor enters address of an IIIF manifest</li>
<li>Information from the manifest is downloaded</li>
<li>(printed books only) If the manifest contains a reference to a
bibliographic database, the record from this database is downloaded; if
not, the editor can supply such a reference; if there is no relevant
bibliographic database, the user can manually create a record</li>
<li>If the manifest or the bibliographical record contain references to
Collections, Persons, and Places, a search for them is done in the
database and, if it fails, in external resources (e.g., GND). The editor
can select the appropriate match or, if necessary, manually search and
ingest or create new authority records.</li>
<li>The editor can select the text illustrated here, medium and, once
the appropriate Making Processes have been determined, enter Artists,
Places, and Dates in these forms.</li>
<li>Texts, Artists and Places are likewise checked against the database
or, if that fails, external resources, the editor can confirm matches,
launch manual searches in external databases, or manually create new
authority records.</li>
<li>If any authority records are found in external resources, they will
be ingested automatically.</li>
<li>A new record is ingested automatically, if there was no record found
in the database but one from external resources, and if there is a
record in the database, but it is only a stub.</li>
<li>If any newly ingested record contains connections to other authority
records (often the case), the connected records are either imported in
full, or the information in the connection is merely used to create
stubs. This will depend on the type of records (e.g., persons connected
to other persons will be normally imported as stubs, but places
connected to a collection as full records. In addition, if there is
already a stub in the database, it would be upgraded to a full record
since it is apparently relevant.**)</li>
<li>The results are saved as a Manuscript or Book record and a
provisional record (currently called ‘Pages’) that contains information
on the individual canvasses of the IIIF manifest as well as the entered
information on illustrated texts and making process. <img
src="./ingest_books_step1.png" alt="Create" /></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-creating-individual-image-records">Step 2: Creating
individual image records</h3>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>All pages of a digitised manuscript and book are downloaded, an
algorithm identifies illustrations (this also includes straightening
them as necessary).</li>
<li>An editor checks and corrects these identifications (probably first
as an overview, to make sure that all pages with illustrations are
selected, and then by manually going through all selected pages and
checking all frames). This would also include manual adjusting</li>
<li>If the IIIF-Manifest does not contain page numbers, they can be
added at this stage by an editor.</li>
<li>For manuscripts, the result is the creation of an Artwork, Image,
and Photo record for every miniature, largely based on information in
the ‘Pages’ record.</li>
<li>For printed books, the result is the creation of an Artwork, Image,
Copy, Photo and Matrix record for every illustration, largely based on
information int the ‘Pages’ record. <img src="./ingest_books_step2.png"
alt="Create" /></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-identifying-re-used-printing-matrices">Step 3:
Identifying re-used printing Matrices</h3>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This step is necessary for printed book illustrations (also for any
printed book illustrations ingested not via this procedure but manually
under <a href="#ingest-photos-from-local-drive">Ingest from local
drive</a>). It does not yet exist in the prototype.</li>
<li>The images are one by one matched with the special repository of
(rather low-res) images of printed book illustrations.</li>
<li>Any match is shown to the editor.</li>
<li>If the editor confirms the match, relevant information from the
Matrix record of the new image is copied into the Matrix record of the
match (if there are any conflicts, the editor decides which version to
use), then the Matrix record of the new image is deleted, and the new
image is connected to the Matrix record of the match instead.</li>
<li>The editor can further copy one reference on an illustrated text and
one or more references to iconographies in the Matrix record to the
Artwork and Image records respectively of the new image. (For practical
reasons, this can be done whether the match was confirmed or not, simply
because it is a labour-saving device).</li>

<h1 id="creating-records">Creating Records</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Individual records are created through the <a
href="#ingest-photos">Ingest</a> procedure above. &gt; Maybe such links
are nice?</li>
<li>Group records are produced partially through the Ingest process
(Matrix record), partially through editing (Cycle record)</li>
<li>Authority records connected directly to Artwork records (Persons,
Institutions, Collections, Texts) will normally be created during the
ingest processes.</li>
<li>Manual creation is typically necessary for Iconography records,
furthermore for some types of records of Objects of depictions that
cannot be ingested from outside databases (probably Personifications,
Activities), for child records of the hierarchical Place and Text
records - furthermore for any Object, for which no record is found in an
external resource.</li>
<li>Manual creation will also be necessary for records representing
general keywords or headings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="connect">Connect</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the information is expressed through connection to other
records (e.g., an Artwork is linked to records for artists and
whereabouts, an Image to records for Iconography, an Iconography to
records for the depicted objects).</li>
<li>The way of creating these links in manually entering data is very
much standardised, hence it is described at the beginning.</li>
<li>There are three different versions: the first applies to most
records, the second to records for Places and Text that exist in
hierarchial chains of Child record, the third for iconographies that may
also offer variants to choose from.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="connect-simple">Connect simple</h3>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The user starts typing in the name of the record to be
connected</li>
<li>Once, enough letters are typed, a search for this string (with the
record type necessary in this context) is made in the database (return
preview only), the result is shown in the UI (if the search has yielded
results, the option ‘none of these’ is always added, if there are no
results, an option ‘external search necessary’ is returned, and by
default selected automatically)</li>
<li>If the user selects one of the search results, it will be connected
to the records</li>
<li>Since external searches take several seconds, it makes most sense if
the user first will in all relevant search boxes for collections and
selects search results (or ‘none of these’)</li>
<li>At the end, a search in external databases can be launched for all
lists of search options, where ‘none of these’or ’external search
necessary’ has been ticked</li>
<li>The user can then select records from these search results - those
would then be ingested into the database</li>
<li>Alternatively, the user could manually create new records and
connect them (this would mean saving the view in which the work just
took place, open a view to create a new record, save it, resume work on
the original view, and select a connection with the newly made
record.)</li>

<h3 id="connect-iconography">Connect Iconography</h3>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The connection to Iconography records functions similar to <a
href="#connect-simple">Connect simple</a>, with the following
differences:</li>
<li>The search in the database does not only yield previews, but also
lists of variants for every iconography (names of variants and short
names of options)</li>
<li>There is no external search - if an Iconography record is not found,
it has to be created manually</li>
<li>Once an Iconography record has been selected (a newly created record
would be selected automatically), a list of all variants is
displayed</li>
<li>The user selects the appropriate option for every variant.</li>
<li>An Edge between the Image and the selected Iconography record is
saved.</li>
<li>The IDs of any selected Options are saved as part of this Edge</li>
</ul>
<figure>

<h3 id="connect-place-text">Connect Place / Text</h3>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Amongst Place and Text records, only high-level records (“Town”,
“Book”) are ingested and supplied with data. Lowever-level records
typically only consist of a name and the Edges linking them upward and
downward.</li>
<li>Hence, there is a simplified way of creating these records:</li>
<li>When creating a link to a Place record (in <a
href="#ingest-photos-from-local-drive">Ingest from local drive</a> or <a
href="#create-iconography">Create Iconography</a>) or to a Text record
(in <a href="#edit-manually">Edit manually</a> / <a
href="#bulk-editing">Bulk editing</a> or<a
href="#create-iconography">Create Iconography</a>), one would normally
search for the ‘Town’ or the ‘Book’ record. If it is in the database, it
would not be displayed alone, but with all child records. The editor
could select an extant Child record or insert at any place the name of a
new Child record (and select the level of this record, e.g. building,
building-part etc., that in turn defines the relation between it and its
parent record.). These records would be saved with no other content than
the name and the Edges linking it to other records. It must be possible
to determine in which place within the series of Child records fo the
Parent records the new record should belong.</li>
<li>It would also be possible to open the record in a separate view to
add more information, if desired.</li>
<li>This is not yet fully thought through. Some child records,
especially building records, but also major subdivisions of texts (e.g.,
Biblical Books) may very well have external authority records that could
be ingested like other Authority records, and it may also make sense
that one searches for them, not for the Town or Book records (which
would be rather voluminous for e.g. the City of Rome, or the Bible).
<img src="./connect_place_text.png" alt="Create" /></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-iconography">Create Iconography</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>First, the type of Iconography has to be selected (Portrait, Emblem,
etc.)</li>
<li>Based on this type, one can enter one or more connected objects in
search boxes and select the connection they have with the iconography
(e..g, ‘portrait of’, ‘acting person’, etc.). The connection to or
ingest or creation of these Authority records is described in \00
general_insert_object and element_insert_object_place_text respectively.
.</li>
<li>A name (and name variants or comments) are given manually (for some
types of iconography, e.g. portraits, a name will be created
automatically out of type and connected objects, which, however, can
still be changed manually).</li>
<li>The Iconclass notation(s) for this iconography are entered, and
hence a link to Iconclass built (all Iconography records without
Iconclass notations will be sent to the Iconclass editorsto consider
creating notations for these Iconographies).</li>
<li>If the iconography has variants (e.g., if an image of a saint
appears with different attributes), these can be catalogued. It makes
sense to have two forms for entering this data - one largely filled in
with simple options ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘unclear’, ‘not yet determined’, and
another that has only the last two options complete, whilst the rest can
be filled in freely. If an option in one of the variants needs
connections to other Object records, they can be entered as described
above. (It should also be possible to combine some variants, especially
attributes, also with Object records, e.g., records of saints). In this
case, once a connection to an Object record is made, one could decide
whether the variants connected with this person should be available in
this iconography record. This needs more thinking (e.g., should the
variant records be copied to the Iconography record and then adjusted or
should simply links to them be available? The latter would be more
elegant but may create some dispaly problems).</li>
<li>At the end, the Iconography record is saved as a Node with Edges to
all connected object records. If variants are defined, probably each
variant, and each option within the variants, is a separate Node.</li>

records</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>These records are very simple - in most cases, one would merely
enter a name and connections to one or two parent headings (in some
situations, there might be some external authority record).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-other-authority-records">Create other Authority

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>This would largely happen for Persons, Organisations, Places, and
Texts for which there are no external authority records - and probably
for all Offices, Personifications and Activities, since there are no
authority records for such concepts (unless I find some, e.g. in the
Getty Data). - Normally, such records would be manually created as part
of in <a href="#ingest">Ingest</a> or in <a

would probably store the record one had been working on in the FE, open
the view to create the new record, and then resume work on the earlier
record. - In order to create a new Authority record, one first has to
select the record type, then add at least one connection to another
record (with relations defined by the record type), and give it a name.
- Child records for Place and Text records that need no information
besides a name and connections to Parent and Child records can also be
created directly when one <a href="#connect-place--text">connects to
Place and Text records</a>.</p>
<h1 id="fill-and-edit-individual-records">Fill and Edit individual
records</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>In virtually all cases (exceptions being perhaps <a
href="#ingest-photos-from-a-museum">records ingested from museum
databases</a> or records that have gone through the <a
href="#step-3-identifying-re-used-printing-matrices">re-used matrix
search</a>), new individual records need manual editing. Most important
for the database is iconographic information in the Image record
(although very few photos may not need it); furthermore, the Artwork
record needs information on Medium, Making Processes, Whereabouts, and,
where applicable, illustrated texts. This can be supported by special
searches that show e.g. only those images in the current ingest process
that have no whereabouts or specific wherabouts. Depending on the
material, there might be several ways of achieving this - which can also
be combined. Later editing of records - which will be comparably rare,
follows the same principles</p>
<h2 id="edit-manually">Edit manually</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>This way of proceeding is called for if either all images need very
different metadata or all fields that do not need different metadata
(e.g., whereabouts, making processes) have been filled in at the <a
href="#ingest">Ingest</a> or through <a href="#bulk-editing">bulk
editing</a>. - One goes to the first image in the current ingest process
that needs to be treated and opens the edit view. This view will combine
all individual records together (Artwork, Image, Copy, Photograph) - if
there are more Image records to an Artwork record, orsimilar for Copy
and Photograph records, one can flip between them. - In this record, all
necessary data can be entered: - In the Artwork record: - Select medium,
then relevant making processes will appear - For any making process
select reliability of attribution (“signed”, “school of”, etc.) and
enter Artist or Place, and Time (if an artist is entered, there is no
need to enter a place, since the preferred place of activity of the
artist will be entered by default - it could be overwritten if it is
incorrect in this case). - Additional making processes can be added (if
consistent with the medium), the order of making processes adjusted. -
Enter whereabouts (either a Collection or a Place - if a Place, Child
records could be added, see <a href="#connect-place--text">Connected
Place - Text</a>). - Additionally, former whereabouts can be added. -
Enter illustrated text, if appropriate (Child records could be added). -
For both whereabouts and illustrated texts it may be the case that a
hierarchically high-up record had already entered earlier in the ingest
process, e.g., the name of a book. In this case, all child records of
this record would be displayed, and one could choose (or create) the
right one for this image, e.g., if the Illustrated text is set to
“Bible”, it could be moved for an individual Artwork record to “Bible”
&gt; “Exodus” &gt; “Opening initial”. -In the Image record, one or more
iconographic records can be added (normally, at least one will be
added). - First, select reliability (“no comments”, “inscription”,
“tentative interpretation” etc.) - Search and select iconography record
- If this iconography record has variants, select the correct options
(by ticking) - any Records (Persons, Collections, Places, Texts,
Iconographies) that do not exist yet can be ingested or manually
created. To do so, the Individual records would be stored and reloaded
once the new record(s) have been created. Then, this procedure is
repeated at the next record. There could be a function that does not
only save the record, but also makes it public, and another that save
it, makes it public, and removes it from the current ingest process.
These functions should include some checking of minimum standards for
publication.</p>
<h2 id="bulk-editing">Bulk editing</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>This procedure is useful if some information (typically, it would be
whereabouts or making processes) have to be added to a number of
records. If one has ingested 100 photos from a church, one might
e.g. mark all the ceiling paintings and link them to the same artist and
date, or mark all images from the high altar and set them to the child
place ‘high altar’. This function will tpically be used for new images
but could also make sense if e.g. it turns out that all miniatures from
a manuscript need to be redated. - Select the images either in the
current ingest process or in search results. - Open the edit screen. It
will look like the edit screen from <a href="#edit-manually">Edit
manually</a>, but all fields in which the individual records have
divergent content will be greyed out. - In this case, there is only one
Image, Copy, and Photograph section in the view, not several ones to
move up and down, since all changes will apply to all records. - If any
field is filled in or changed, these changes will apply to all records
that have been marked. - If one tries to change a greyed-out field, one
receives a warning - if one discards it, all the individual contents of
this field will be replaced by the new content.</p>
<h2 id="copy-information">Copy information</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>This procedure is useful for Manuscripts and Books. Often, copy of
the same text have very similar images at more or less the same places.
If one such manuscript or book has been fully catalogued, and a second
one is ingested, the following procedure could be used. - Select the
manuscript or book record of the model and the manuscript and book
record of the new material - Open a view with a split screen that shows
the first image connected to either manuscript or book record - If
necessary, move forward on either side until both series are in sync (if
the first images of the new material have no counterpart in the model,
one would manually assign to them the Iconography and Illustrated Text
information). - Once both books are in sync, the following options are
available - Copy Illustrated Text and Iconography information (with
variants) and move both sides one image on - Copy Illustrated Text and
Iconography information, but select variants for the new image manually,
and move both sides on image on - Copy only Illustrated Text or nothing
at all, if there is not match, and enter the missing information
manually - If the series are getting out of sync, move only one side
(again, if a new image has no counterpart, one should supply information
manually) - Should the editor notice that some information in the model
is incorrect, it should be possible to correct it on the spot. Since
this procedure can take some time (in some cases, there may be several
hundred images), it must be possible to interrupt and resume it.</p>

<h2 id="merge-individual-records">Merge individual records</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>This can be necessary if a group of photos was imported as ‘different
Artworks’, but some of them are actually Images belonging to one and the
same Artwork, or Copies belonging to one and the same Image record, or
Photos belonging to one and the same Copy record. - In this case, one
has to mark all relevant records (either in a view of a current ingest,
or in a search view), select and option ‘merge’ and indicate if the
merging should place on Artwork, Image, or Copy level. - If the records
that are to be merged contain conflicting information, one is asked,
which information to keep in the merged record - After the merger,
e.g. all Images will be connected to one Artwork record.</p>
<p>It would also be relatively simple to have a function that would
atomise the record, i.e. clone the Artwork, Image and Copy records so
many times that every Artwork record is only connected to one Image,
Copy, and Photo record (also this could be done on different
levels).</p>
<p>With a combination of these two functions, one could probably do all
merging and separating operations that might become necessary, albeit in
an awkward way. Since I expect such operations to be very rare, this
might be sufficient, but one might also built something more
comfortable, that would show all Image, Copy, and Photo records
belonging to an Artwork as a tree, on which elements could be moved
around.</p>
<h2 id="connect-individual-records">Connect Individual Records</h2>
<p>Connections are possible on the Artwork and on the Image levels -
Connections on the Artwork level are used if one Artwork is the copy of
another, or if one Artwork played a role in the creation of another
artwork (e.g., a preparative drawing and a finished painting) -
Connections on the Image level mean that there are distinct works of art
that either show together a scene (e.g., an Annunciation distributed
over two outer wings of an altarpiece) or that they belong together in a
typological relationship. - In order to create a relationship one would
either show the records side-by-side on a split screen, or copy the
Artwork (or Image) ID of one and then close it and open the other. In
either case, one would then select ‘Connect’ (perhaps through a context
menu) and select the connection type. - The connction is merely and Edge
between the two records. - The difficulty is in the UI, to make sure
that the connection is between the right Images, if there are several
Images per Artwork (it may not be evident for the user, what is on the
Artwork, and what on the Image level). - It must be possible to change
the connection type and to delete the connection.</p>
<h1 id="fill-and-edit-group-records">Fill and Edit Group records</h1>
<h2 id="create-cycle-records">Create Cycle records</h2>
<p>Image Cycles are groups of Images that have a common iconographic
theme and belong to artworks that are (or at least were) in one place
(e.g., Scenes from the life of saint XY painted in a church) A cycle
always has a theme that is treated like an Iconography Authority record
(e.g., “Life of Saint XY”, “Four Continents”). It furthermore has all
the information on the Artwork record shared by all members of the cycle
(can be Medium, Making Processes, Locations, perhaps Illustrated texts).
The following steps are needed to create a Cycle: - Select the records
of Images that would become part of it (normally in a search for
images). Ideally, one would select them in narrative order - The system
compares the related Artwork records and copies the information shared
by all images into the new Cycle record (needs checking and manual
correction) - If there are different Locations, but all are parts of one
building, the Building record is shown here. - If there is different
information in different Artwork records, the user decides which one to
take - Manually select Theme of Cycle (or create new Theme record, if
needed) - Manually correct ordering of images according to narrative
order (by drag and drop) <img src="./create_cycle.png"
alt="Create" /></p>
<h2 id="edit-cycle-records">Edit Cycle records</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>The following actions would be necessary: - Add more Images to a
Cycle record. If the connected Artwork data of these Image is in
conflict with the Artwork data of the Cycle, it might be best to notify
user to solve the problem with manual corrections. In any case, the
Cycle screen shoud appear because one probably would have to change the
narrative order. - Remove images from Cycle record. - Merge Cycles:
Could perhaps simply be done by searching for all images in one Cycle,
selecting them, adding them to another Cycle, and deleting the original
Cycle - Change Artwork Data / Theme / Order of images - Delete Cycle:
Simply delete Node for Cycle and all Edges connected to it</p>
<p>## Edit Matrix records <a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>These records would be created automatically when <a
href="#step-3-identifying-re-used-printing-matrices">re-used printing
matrices are identified</a>. Any manual editing would be probably only
needed if something has gone wrong: - Artwork was connected by mistake
to a Matrix and has to be removed from it. - Edge between Matrix and
Artwork records is deleted - If this Artwork record was the only example
for a specific Illustrated Text or a specific Iconography connected to
this Matrix, the links to this Illustrationed Text or Iconography are
deleted from the Matrix record. - By default, the earliest impression of
a Matrix is shown when running through <a
href="#step-3-identifying-re-used-printing-matrices">identify re-used
printing matrices</a>. If this image is unsuitable (e.g., incomplete)
one could manually select another default image. - There may be a need
to add bibliographical references or comments to a Matrix record (or,
one would add them to an Artwork and tick a box that they should apply
for the Matrix - the latter might be more user-friendly).</p>
<h1 id="fill-end-edit-authority-records">Fill end edit Authority
records</h1>
<h2 id="complete-information-in-authority-records">Complete information
in Authority records</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>Authority records as ingested automatically from the GND or another
source often lack some information that is needed for Iconobase. This
information could either be added immediately after ingesting the new
record or later, before the record is made public.</p>
<p>It could mean two things: - Determining the type of an authority
record (e.g., is a depicted person a historical figure, a mythological
figure, etc.I) - Creating links to other records - e.g., a ‘historical
figure’ must be defined by a place, a date, and a profession, however
vague (or, in many cases easier, by an office and dates), an artist must
have a preferred place of activity, a town must belong to a region, and
an animal species to larger groups. - If a place of activity is assigned
to an artist, all Making processes with this artist and no link to a
place are to be supplied with this place or activity as place. This
would be done through manual editing. One would probably go through all
unpublished Authority records in an Ingest process, open them and be
prompted which information was still missing.</p>
<h2 id="edit-authority-records">Edit Authority records</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>Manual editing of Authority records is possible in many ways, e.g.  -
Add, change, or remove names or variant names - Add or remove references
to external Authority records - Add or remove connections to other
Authority records</p>
<ul>
<li>For Place and Text records: change the order of Child records, move
one or more Child records to another Parent record, rename Child record,
or change rank of Child record</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="delete-authority-records">Delete Authority Records</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>This action would be needed very rarely in production node, more
common would be a merger (see below). - Authority records cannot be
deleted, if they still have meaningful connections. - There are three
scenarios: - Record has no connections at all - it can be deleted -
Record is only connected to stubs - it can be deleted together with the
stubs - Record of type Place or Text is only connected to Parent record
(and perhaps to stubs) - it can be deleted (together with the stubs,
should there be any) - Record is not connected to any individual or
group record but to one and only one other Authority record - it can be
demoted to a stub, all stubs connected to it can be deleted - Record is
connected to two or more authority records and/or to at least on
individual or Group record - it cannot be deleted nor demoted to a stub
- If the record is deleted or demoted to a stub, all stubs connected to
it are deleted, as are all Edges connecting to this record. - If the
record cannot be deleted, a list of all connected records that prevent
the deletion from happening, has to be sent to the UI.</p>
<h2 id="merge-authority-records">Merge Authority Records</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<p>This action would normally be used (instead of deleting above) if it
became obvious that two Authority records actually denote the same
thing. - User selects two authority records, either with search on split
screen, or searching one, copying its ID, searching the other, chose
‘Merge’ and enter the ID of the other record. - A merger is only
possible between two records of the same record type (e.g. two persons)
- For all Attributes of record B: - If an Attribute that can be repeated
(e.g., variant name) exists in record B but not in record A, it is
copied to record A - If an Attrbute that cannot be repeated (e.g.,
preferred name, sex, geographical coordinates) exists in both records A
and B, but with different values, the user has to decide which ones to
take over - For all Edges containing the ID of record B: - If record B
has a connection to a record and record A has a connection to the same
record with the same attributes, the connection of record B is deleted -
if record B has a connection to a record to which record A has no
connection, the ID of record B in the Edge is replaced with the ID or
record A - if both record A nad B have connections to the same authority
record, but with different attributes, the user has to decide which will
be used for merged record (mixing and matching of attributes allowed) -
of if both connections actually mean different things, and both are to
be retained - e.g. if one connects an artist and a town as ‘born in’ and
another as ‘active in’ (in any connection that is to be retained, all
references to record B have to be replaced with references to record A.)
- All connections + - The ID of record B is added as attribute ‘former
ID’ or so to record A (this is needed for iconography records in case
that there some outside resource referred to its ID, but it may make
sense to do this always) - The Node for record B is being deleted (all
Edges leading to it should have been deleted by the steps before)</p>
<h1 id="search">Search</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Contents</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Virtually all searches go for some elements of Authority records
(e.g. works by certain artists, works in certain locations, works
showing certain iconographies). ONly a search for a museum inventory
number or an auction lot number would go for the Edge between an Artwork
record and an Authority record (a search for a manusript shelf mark
would search for the Edge between two Authority records). There might be
also searches for specific IDs of individual records used when editing
the database.</li>
<li>If a search is for an Authority record, it can have two intended
results:
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the Authority record as data. It would be rather use to
browse from and and see if there are other relevant Authority records,
and then to display the images connected to them.</li>
<li>Secondly, the search could go for all individual records connected
to the found Authority records. Two things have to be kept in mind:
<ul>
<li>There may be different connections, and not all of them relevant for
the search (e.g., a search for portraits of Michelangelo should not turn
out works by Michelangelo) - however, it may also be that a user wants
to see more than one connection (e.g., all images showing Michelangelo,
be their portraits or history paintings) or simply anything connected to
a certain Authority record</li>
<li>Depending on the type of connection, there may be rather different
paths. A search for works of art made by Michelangelo would, for
instance to search for an Person named Michelangelo that has the type
‘Artist’, copy its ID, and look for Artwork records that have this ID in
their Making processes. A search for Images of all Types featuring
Michelangelo would search for a Person named Michelangelo that has the
type ‘Depicted Person’ (one and the same record for Michelangelo would
have both types, if both works by and images of him are in the
database), search for all Iconography records related to this person
record and then search all Image records connected to one of these
Iconography records and then show search the connected Artwork record
(with a preview image of taken from that Image and Photo records that
are marked as ‘Preferred’ for the Iconography ‘Michelangelo’, if there
are more). A still more complex example: One might search for saints
that have as attribute a candle. Here, one would first search for the
object ‘candle’ and search for all Iconography records this record is
connected to. However, one has to filter them so that all records that
are not linked to Persons with the attribute ‘Saint’ are excluded, and
one has to filter the search for Image records to those that also
contain the Option ID for the variant that a ‘candle’ is shown.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="options-for-search-up-front">Options for Search up-front</h2>
<ul>
<li>This means that one will need a UI with a number of different search
boxes, and that one needs a number of different searches - some of them
with recursive elements, in the BFF.</li>
<li>This search will happen partially ‘up front’ through search boxes,
partially ‘afterwards’ in the results view through different
facets.</li>
<li>The search screen should probably have the following options:
<ul>
<li>free search (would search in names of all Authority files)</li>
<li>Person (with options Artist - Author - Printer - Depicted Person -
Owner of Coat-of-Arms etc.)</li>
<li>Place (with options Place of Making - Whereabouts, in the latter
case Option to exclude Whereabouts that are Collections)</li>
<li>Inventory number of shelf mark (both together with a Collection or
alone, some shelf marks are so idiosyncratic that they do not appear in
more than one collection)</li>
<li>Text (with options Illustrated Text - Iconography inspired by
text)</li>
<li>Personification</li>
<li>Animal or Plant</li>
<li>Thing</li>
<li>Action</li>
<li>General Keyword</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="options-for-filtering-sorting-and-structuring-results-through-facets">Options
for filtering, sorting, and structuring results through facets</h2>
<ul>
<li>The facets in the results view should allow three things (although
not all all three things): filtering results, sorting results, and
structuring - the latter is like sorting, but puts inserts a heading
each time there is a new term in sorting. Each item in a facet should
come with the number of search hits in this facet. If a hit fits with
more than one facets (e.g., two different artists), it would probably
make most sense to repeat it in sorting or structuring results.</li>
<li>The following facets are needed
<ul>
<li>Medium:
<ul>
<li>in alphabetical order</li>
<li>for filtering, sorting results, and structuring results</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Artist:
<ul>
<li>in alphabetical order</li>
<li>for filtering, sorting results, and structuring results</li>
<li>Place of making
<ul>
<li>hierarchical: Region (there could be several levels), then town</li>
<li>for filtering and structuring results (also hierarchically, mere
sorting would make little sense)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Date:
<ul>
<li>for sorting the thumbnails in chronological order (for most searches
default setting), and for filtering. (Also in case of
sorting/structuring according to other criteria, any hits that are equal
in relation to the sorting criterion should be sorted by date)</li>
<li>Structuring results may be possible by century or by decade
depending on temporal distribution of results</li>
<li>For filtering dates, one would not have dates to choose from, but
rather give start and end dates, either through manual entering or
through moving slides. The number of hits would not be shows as figures
but as a curve.</li>
<li>Question: should the start date, or an average of start and end date
be used for sorting / structuring?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Location:
<ul>
<li>also hierarchical, from Region (in this case modern administrative
region) down to building parts and composite artworks</li>
<li>includes by default also Collections (defined as organisations) -
although it must be possible to exclude them</li>
<li>it must likewise be possible to exclude former Locations.</li>
<li>for filtering and structuring results (also hierarchically, mere
sorting would make little sense)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Illustrated Text:
<ul>
<li>also hierarchical, from Titel (and author) down to passages and
quotes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>for filtering and structuring results (also hierarchically, mere
sorting would make little sense)
<ul>
<li>Page number:
<ul>
<li>Default sorting for searches searches of illustrations of a specific
manuscript or book</li>
<li>Only needed for sorting, not for filtering and structuring (the
latter is plausible, but I don’t see the point)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Iconography:
<ul>
<li>by default in alphabetical order (I don’t think that there are other
possibilities). However, if the search was iconographical (e.g., for all
iconographies showing a certain person), all connections would be shown
sorted first by connection type and then by the order of the connections
(e.g., if one searches for scenes from the Life of Christ, the Nativity
would come before the Circumcision)</li>
<li>for filtering and structuring (mere sorting would make little
sense)</li>
<li>If an iconography has variants, filtering and perhaps structuring
could be done according to these variants (if there are too many,
structuring would be a mess, with maybe 100 groups, most only containing
1-2 thumbnails)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>There should be also possibilities for browsing. This would be
easily achievable for lists that could be filtered with facets (e.g.,
depicted persons filtered into saints, mythological figures etc.), and
for other items that are in a hierarchical structure (e.g., Places,
Plants/Animals). Probably, there would be some ‘general browsing’ mode
as in the Warburg Database so that one could from one point get to
everywhere. This is primarily for finding authority records, but if one
is specialised enough for the number of connected images to be
relatively small, one could show that (it makes no sense to show the
first 200 thumbnails for ‘Christianity’)</li>
</ul>
